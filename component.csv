More Details
============

The router's web interface enables users to generate new X.509
certificates directly on the device. A user may enter typical
configuration parameters required for the certificate, such as
organisation, the common name and so on. In order to generate the
certificate, the device uses the command-line program openssl [2]. The
device's firmware uses the following format string to assemble the
openssl command:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
openssl req -new  -nodes  -subj '/C=%s/ST=%s/L=%s/O=%s/OU=%s/CN=%s/emailAddress=%s' -keyout %s%s.key -sha256 -out %s%s.csr -days %s -newkey rsa:%s  > /dev/null 2>&1
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although the web interface filters certain special characters via
JavaScript, there is actually no input filtering, escaping or encoding
happening on the server. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary
commands.",the web-based certificate generator feature,5

More Details
============

The router's web interface enables users to generate new X.509
certificates directly on the device. A user may enter typical
configuration parameters required for the certificate, such as
organisation, the common name and so on. In order to generate the
certificate, the device uses the command-line program openssl [2]. The
device's firmware uses the following format string to assemble the
openssl command:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
openssl req -new  -nodes  -subj '/C=%s/ST=%s/L=%s/O=%s/OU=%s/CN=%s/emailAddress=%s' -keyout %s%s.key -sha256 -out %s%s.csr -days %s -newkey rsa:%s  > /dev/null 2>&1
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although the web interface filters certain special characters via
JavaScript, there is actually no input filtering, escaping or encoding
happening on the server. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary
commands.",the web-based certificate generator feature,1

Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker in the LAN. See below for other constraints.
Affected versions:
- ZyXEL P660HN-T1A, hardware revision v1, TrueOnline firmware version 340ULM0b31, other firmware versions might be affected

This router has a command injection vulnerability in the Maintenance > Logs > System Log > Remote System Log forwarding function.
The vulnerability is in the ViewLog.asp page, which is accessible unauthenticated. The following request will cause the router to issue 3 ping requests to 10.0.99.102:

POST /cgi-bin/ViewLog.asp HTTP/1.1
remote_submit_Flag=1&remote_syslog_Flag=1&RemoteSyslogSupported=1&LogFlag=0&remote_host=%3bping+-c+3+10.0.99.102%3b%23&remoteSubmit=Save

The command in injection is in the remote_host parameter.
This vulnerability was found during a black box assessment of the web interface, so the injection path was not fully investigated. All commands run as root.","the Maintenance > Logs > System Log > Remote System Log forwarding function, the ViewLog.asp page",3
