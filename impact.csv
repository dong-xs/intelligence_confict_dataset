CVE-2020-9054,"Multiple ZyXEL network-attached storage (NAS) devices running firmware version 5.21 contain a pre-authentication command injection vulnerability, which may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable device. ZyXEL NAS devices achieve authentication by using the weblogin.cgi CGI executable. This program fails to properly sanitize the username parameter that is passed to it. If the username parameter contains certain characters, it can allow command injection with the privileges of the web server that runs on the ZyXEL device. Although the web server does not run as the root user, ZyXEL devices include a setuid utility that can be leveraged to run any command with root privileges. As such, it should be assumed that exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution with root privileges. By sending a specially-crafted HTTP POST or GET request to a vulnerable ZyXEL device, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the device. This may happen by directly connecting to a device if it is directly exposed to an attacker. However, there are ways to trigger such crafted requests even if an attacker does not have direct connectivity to a vulnerable devices.

Description: An attacker can force the Linux kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, each of which contains only 8 bytes of data. This drastically increases the bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data. Further, it consumes additional resources (CPU and NIC processing power). This attack requires continued effort from the attacker and the impacts will end shortly after the attacker stops sending traffic.",consumes additional resources (CPU and NIC processing power),"CVE-2019-11479: Excess Resource Consumption Due to Low MSS Values (all Linux versions).

More Details
============

The Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router provides a web-based
configuration interface, which is implemented in various CGI programs in
the device's firmware. Access to this web interface requires prior
authentication using a username and password. Previously, RedTeam
Pentesting identified a vulnerability (rt-sa-2018-002) [2] in the CGI
program:

/cgi-bin/config.exp

By issuing an HTTP GET request to this program, it was possible to
export a router's configuration without providing any prior
authentication. This vulnerability was adressed in firmware version
1.4.2.19 published by Cisco [3].

RedTeam Pentesting discovered that the CGI program in the patched
firmware is still vulnerable. By performing a specially crafted HTTP
POST request, attackers are still able to download the router's
configuration. The user agent ""curl"" is blacklisted by the firmware and
must be adjusted in the HTTP client. Again, exploitation does not
require any authentication.","download the router's
