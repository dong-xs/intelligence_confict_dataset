(from the Cisco RV320 product page [1])


More Details
============

The router's web interface enables users to generate new X.509
certificates directly on the device. A user may enter typical
configuration parameters required for the certificate, such as
organisation, the common name and so on. In order to generate the
certificate, the device uses the command-line program openssl [2]. The
device's firmware uses the following format string to assemble the
openssl command:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
openssl req -new  -nodes  -subj '/C=%s/ST=%s/L=%s/O=%s/OU=%s/CN=%s/emailAddress=%s' -keyout %s%s.key -sha256 -out %s%s.csr -days %s -newkey rsa:%s  > /dev/null 2>&1

JavaScript, there is actually no input filtering, escaping or encoding
happening on the server. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary
commands.",1.4.2.15 and later,"A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges on an affected device to execute arbitrary commands.

More Details
============

The router's web interface enables users to generate new X.509
certificates directly on the device. Previously, RedTeam Pentesting
identified a vulnerability (rt-sa-2018-004) [2] in this component. By
providing a specially crafted common name, it was possible to inject
shell commands which were subsequently executed on the router as the
root user. This vulnerability was adressed in firmware version 1.4.2.19
published by Cisco [3].

More Details
============

The router's web interface enables users to generate new X.509
certificates directly on the device. Previously, RedTeam Pentesting
identified a vulnerability (rt-sa-2018-004) [2] in this component. By
providing a specially crafted common name, it was possible to inject
shell commands which were subsequently executed on the router as the
root user. This vulnerability was adressed in firmware version 1.4.2.19
published by Cisco [3].

More Details
============

The router's web interface enables users to generate new X.509
certificates directly on the device. A user may enter typical
configuration parameters required for the certificate, such as
organisation, the common name and so on. In order to generate the
certificate, the device uses the command-line program openssl [2]. The
device's firmware uses the following format string to assemble the
openssl command:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
openssl req -new  -nodes  -subj '/C=%s/ST=%s/L=%s/O=%s/OU=%s/CN=%s/emailAddress=%s' -keyout %s%s.key -sha256 -out %s%s.csr -days %s -newkey rsa:%s  > /dev/null 2>&1
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although the web interface filters certain special characters via
JavaScript, there is actually no input filtering, escaping or encoding
happening on the server. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary
commands.",1.4.2.15 and later,3
