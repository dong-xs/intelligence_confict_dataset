More Details
============

The router's web interface enables users to generate new X.509
certificates directly on the device. A user may enter typical
configuration parameters required for the certificate, such as
organisation, the common name and so on. In order to generate the
certificate, the device uses the command-line program openssl [2]. The
device's firmware uses the following format string to assemble the
openssl command:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
openssl req -new  -nodes  -subj '/C=%s/ST=%s/L=%s/O=%s/OU=%s/CN=%s/emailAddress=%s' -keyout %s%s.key -sha256 -out %s%s.csr -days %s -newkey rsa:%s  > /dev/null 2>&1
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although the web interface filters certain special characters via
JavaScript, there is actually no input filtering, escaping or encoding
happening on the server. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary
commands.",the WAN interface of the router,sending malicious HTTP POST requests,4
,"A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges on an affected device to execute arbitrary commands.

The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP POST requests to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux shell as root.

This vulnerability affects Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers running Firmware Releases 1.4.2.15 through 1.4.2.20.",the WAN interface of the router,providing a specially crafted common name,4

More Details
============

The router's web interface enables users to generate new X.509
certificates directly on the device. Previously, RedTeam Pentesting
identified a vulnerability (rt-sa-2018-004) [2] in this component. By
providing a specially crafted common name, it was possible to inject
shell commands which were subsequently executed on the router as the
root user. This vulnerability was adressed in firmware version 1.4.2.19
published by Cisco [3].

RedTeam Pentesting discovered that the certificate generator in the patched
firmware is still vulnerable. The update adds several filters to handle
single quotes in user input. However, these filters can be evaded by
specially crafted inputs. By providing the following string for the
certificate's common name, a ""ping"" command can be injected:",sending malicious HTTP POST requests,providing a specially crafted common name,4

Introduction
============

""Keep your employees, your business, and yourself productive and
effective. The Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router is an ideal
choice for any small office or small business looking for performance,
security, and reliability in its network.""
(from the Cisco RV320 product page [1])


More Details
============

The Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router provides a web-based
configuration interface, which is implemented in various CGI programs in
the device's firmware. Access to this web interface requires prior
authentication using a username and password. Previously, RedTeam
Pentesting identified a vulnerability (rt-sa-2018-002) [2] in the CGI
program:

/cgi-bin/config.exp

By issuing an HTTP GET request to this program, it was possible to
export a router's configuration without providing any prior
authentication. This vulnerability was adressed in firmware version
1.4.2.19 published by Cisco [3].

RedTeam Pentesting discovered that the CGI program in the patched
firmware is still vulnerable. By performing a specially crafted HTTP
POST request, attackers are still able to download the router's
configuration. The user agent ""curl"" is blacklisted by the firmware and
must be adjusted in the HTTP client. Again, exploitation does not
require any authentication.",issuing an HTTP GET request to this program,,
